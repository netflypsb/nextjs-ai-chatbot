## Description

Phase 4.1 also builds the landing page for solaris web application with promotional and educational contents in preparation for initial launch of the service. 

## Part 1 - Completion of Phase 4
1. PLease review the implementation of phase 4 as planned in C:\Users\netfl\TRIAL\nextjs-ai-chatbot\phase4\plan.md, ensure that everything is complete pending the database migration. 
2. Make it so that previous chat threads that users have already created which are not part of any Projects (because the threads were created before Projects was introduced) are accounted for and the new projects feature and database account for existing chat threads and artifacts. Make it so that ALL chat threads and artifacts MUST be associated with a Project. Make any existing chat threads and artifacts part of a 'Template Project'. Chat threads and artifacts are associated with their respective Project. 
3. Make it so that document access tools are confined to the CURRENTLY ACTIVE PROJECT.
