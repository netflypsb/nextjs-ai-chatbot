# Instructions for phase 5
Analyse the below ideas, issues. Then Perform the necessary code analyses and also research. Then Create a plan for implementing the changes. Then implement the plan. 

## Instruction 1 - Web search and browser automation
1. Delete the web search tool, this is the tool that uses brave/duckduckgo search. The API key for this tool is not provided and it doesnt work. 
2. Review the system prompt, make sure to delete the use of the deleted web search tool. 
3. For web search, browser automation, instruct the agent in the system prompt to use agent browser and browserbase tools. list the tools and instruct the agent to use the necessary SKILLS to optimise its use of the tools.
4. Add a special section in the system prompt to instruct the agent to use agent-browser skill to learn how best to use agent-browser tool and browserbase skill to learn how best to use browserbase tools, AND also instruct the agent to use online-research skill on guidelines on how to perform online research effectively and web-tool skill on best practices for using web tools.

## Instruction 2 - Presentation document improvement
1. Review the implementation of presentation document type.  C:\Users\netfl\TRIAL\nextjs-ai-chatbot\phase5\2.presentation-limits.md describes the current implementation and its limitations and what is possible. 
2. Based on your analysis, consider what is possible to implement considering that Solaris Web is a web application and uses database for data storage and is deployed on vercel. Then plan to implement the improvements. The Aim is to make presentation documents more interactive and engaging, enable theme, coloring, visualisations. 
3. Plan for a presentation-skill, an agent skill that makes Solaris into an expert at creating beautiful, interactive, visualy appealing slide presentations that are properly formatted for rendering and for download into ppt/pptx format. Research online for existing skills and guidelines in using markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies to create interactive presentations (whichever is possible to implement in Solaris Web).

## Instruction 3 - skills
1. Analyse the documentation on 'agent skills' in C:\Users\netfl\TRIAL\nextjs-ai-chatbot\phase5\3.agent-skills.md. Consider the architecture of Solaris Web which is a web application and uses database for data storage. Try to avoid using bash commands and external services when considering the solution. then consider the best way to implement agent skills in Solaris Web. The Aim of agent skills is to make solaris into an expert at specific things, enable it to only load the necessary material for skills when needed so that it saves context window. 
2. Create a plan for implementing agent skills in Solaris Web. 
3. Plan for creating the following skills:
   - agent-browser skill to learn how best to use the agent-browser tool. Analyse the agent browser tool and also refer to the source code for the agent browser tool: https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser to create the skill.
   - browserbase skill to make the agent into a specialist at using the browserbase tools. carefully analyse the tool and refer to the browserbase documentations: https://docs.browserbase.com/introduction/what-is-browserbase
   - online-research skill to make the agent into an online research specialist, a specialist at performing online research effectively, include best practices for online research, using differnt search terms, iterating search terms based on previous results. Research best practices for online research and include them in the skill.
   - web-tool skill to make the agent into a specialist at using web tools, include best practices for using web tools, how to search for web tools, how to use browser automation tools to interact with web tools. Since we have 2 browser automation tools (agent-browser and browserbase), create separate sections for each tool, allow agents do discover the correct tool that it intends to use.
   - Presentation Skill - this skill makes Solaris into an expert at creating slide presentations using the existing slide tools and capabilities. 

   ## Instruction 4 - System prompt optimisation

   1. Based on the changes done in phase 5, optimise the system prompt by deleting tools that have been deleted (web search tool), optimise prompt to use agent-browser and browserbase for online research and browser automation, but make the instructions concise and clear AND strongly instruct the agent to activate the relevant skills to enhance performance. 
   2. Add strong instructions to use the appropriate skills when needed and to activate them when necessary.

   ## Instruction 5 - tool setting 
   1. Review tool setting in the UI. Is it working properly? C:\Users\netfl\TRIAL\nextjs-ai-chatbot\phase5\4.available-tools.md lists 16 tools available to the agent. Analyse the code base to determine the existence and function of these tools. 
   2. Analyse C:\Users\netfl\TRIAL\nextjs-ai-chatbot\phase5\5.tool-search-tool.md and also do online research to understand how this concept is impleemnted to save token usage and improve performance. PLan for implementing this with solaris tools. 
   My suggestion is to ONLY make Document Management tools as 'Core' tools that are always available to the agent. All other tools MUST be listed in the system prompt as available tools that the agent can search for and use when needed, and the agent must be instructed to search for the tools and use them. 
   IF Skills will be made as document type that the agent can search for and read, then skill search tools should also be made into core tools, and if there will be separate tools for searching for tools, then these must also be core tools.
