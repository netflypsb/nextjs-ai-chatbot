Looking at the presentation implementation, you're right that it's quite limited. The current presentation system only supports basic markdown formatting:

## **Current Limitations**

**Themes & Colors**: No - the renderer uses hardcoded inline styles with basic colors (white background, dark text). No theme system.

**Images**: No - the [renderMarkdownToHtml](cci:1://file:///c:/Users/netfl/TRIAL/nextjs-ai-chatbot/artifacts/presentation/client.tsx:26:0-60:1) function doesn't handle image markdown syntax `![alt](url)`.

**Advanced Styling**: Very limited - only basic headings, bold/italic, lists, and blockquotes.

## **What's Currently Supported**

- Headings (H1, H2, H3) with fixed sizes
- Bold and italic text
- Ordered and unordered lists  
- Blockquotes (styled as speaker notes)
- Basic slide navigation with thumbnails

## **Possible Enhancements**

The system could be extended to support:
- Image rendering with `![alt](url)` syntax
- CSS themes/classes instead of inline styles
- Background colors and gradients
- Custom slide layouts
- Embedded HTML/CSS for advanced styling

The current implementation is intentionally simple for reliability, but the architecture allows for significant enhancement of the markdown-to-HTML conversion function.
